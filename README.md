# first_bootcamp_project_on_game_sales

## Goal:  

Identify patterns that determine whether a game will succeed or not to identify potential big winners and plan marketing campaigns.

## Data

The data set consists of historical game sales data scraped from open sources. 
16715 entries, each with 11 parameters: 

      * Name
      * Platform
      * Year_of_Release
      * Genre
      * NA_sales (North American sales in USD million)
      * EU_sales (sales in Europe in USD million)
      * JP_sales (sales in Japan in USD million)
      * Other_sales (sales in other countries in USD million)
      * Critic_Score (maximum of 100)
      * User_Score (maximum of 10)

  The data set is generally informative, but there are many missing values in Scores and Ratings.
